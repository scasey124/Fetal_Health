# Fetal_Health
Chosen final portfolio project 

For the final portfolio project in Codecademy's Data Scientist career path, we were given free range to pick a topic of our choice and evaluate the data as we see fit. As a result, I chose a dataset related to health. The dataset was found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification) and contains data from cardiotocograms exams, a cost accessible option to assess fetal health, which allows healthcare professions to intervene, if necessary, to prevent child and maternal mortality. I referenced and learned from various sources of code in order to create my machine models, including Pipeline, which was key in evaluating which model was best for the given data. 



PS: I'd like to thank the Kaggle community for being a wealth of knowledge, especially those who took the time to explain the thought processes behind their codes. I learned so much from everyone.
