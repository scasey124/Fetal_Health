# Fetal_Health
Chosen final portfolio project 

For the final portfolio project in Codecademy's Data Scientist career path, we were given free range to pick a topic of our choice and evaluate the data as we see fit. As a result, I chose a dataset related to health. The dataset was found on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification) and contains data from cardiotocograms exams, a cost accessible option to assess fetal health, which allows healthcare professions to intervene, if necessary, to prevent child and maternal mortality. I referenced and learned from various sources of code in order to create my machine models, including Pipeline, which was key in evaluating which model was best for the given data. 



(*I'd also like to thank the Kaggle community for being a wealth of knowledge. I learned so much from everyone.)
